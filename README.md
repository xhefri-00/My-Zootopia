*---Animal Information Web Generator---*
________________
This project allows users to input the name of any animal through the terminal, and it will fetch relevant information about that animal from an API. The information is then dynamically rendered into a website, where users can view details like the animal's diet, habitat, color, and more.

*Animal Information Fetching*: 

Users can input any animal's name, and the project fetches detailed data about that animal using the API Ninjas service.

*Dynamic HTML Generation*: 

The fetched data is formatted into a pre-defined HTML template, creating a webpage that displays the animal's characteristics, habitat, and other information.

*Interactive Command Line*: 

Users can easily interact with the program by typing in an animal's name directly from the terminal.

*How It Works*:
________________

The user inputs the name of an animal in the terminal.
The program fetches data from an external API using the data_fetcher.fetch_data function.
The fetched data is inserted into a pre-designed HTML template.
A new HTML file is generated, which users can open in a browser to view the animal's information.
